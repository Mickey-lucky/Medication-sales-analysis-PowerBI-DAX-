# Medication-sales-analysis


## Introduction 
Project Overview: The project delved into medication sales datasets over the past several years. The dashboard explored sales data from 5 csv tables and extracted multi-faceted insights, product-wise, customer-wise and sales trend etc. The dashboard included multiple filter slicers, such as year, month, buyer type, country and parameters, such as top/bottom , TOPN . The performance KPIs are benchmarked against last month performance.

## Tools & Platform 
Power BI Desktop, CSV file, Dax Language, Power 

## Dax Functions Used:
Calculate, TOPN, Switch, Divide, Sum/SUMX, Selectedvalue, Variable, Dateadd, If, Addcolumns, ConcatenateX etc.

## Key Steps:
1.	loaded data from CSV files to Power BI. Introduced 4 dimension tables (DrugLookup, CustomerTable, RegulatoryTable) and 1 fact sales tables
2.	Performed data cleaning and ETL in power query
3.	Bulit table relationship

•	Created TOPN parameter and KPI slicers to filter top/underperforming products <br>
• Used image-based navigation action for page navigation<br>
• Developed dynamic titles that adapt based on the selected slicers and parameters<br>
